- There will be a third page (*Sign-up*) to access a sign-up form. The sign-up form will have a field where the users must enter their email for easier administration by the site owner.

#### Design choices

The overall intended feeling of the website is supposed to be an inviting and cozy-gaming atmosphere. The following design choices for this project was made with this in mind. 

**Color palette**

![An image of the color palette for the website](./docs/colors/Color_palette.png)

**Contrast checker**

- Changed the light pink to a lighter shade since is didn't pass the contrast checker with the dark purple. From #D07ACE to #D68AD5. 

- I also decided to change the purple color to a darker shade since it only worked with the white color. Now it works with the blue shade as well. From #5D18BD to #3E117E.

**Fonts**

- The fonts for all h1 elements are Passion One, for other heading elements Roboto Mono, and for the body text Titillium Web. I chose these three because they complement each other and create a dynamic trio. The choices were also made with the idea that they could reflect elements of gaming. 

- <mark>As back-up fonts I chose XX for h1 elements, XX for other heading elements and XX for body text. </mark>
